# Annual Stock Analysis
Creating a tool using VBA scripting to analyze annual stock data.

## Project Overview
Steve, a friend who recently graduated with his finance degree, wants to help his parents make smart investment decisions within the green energy sector. Steve has provided us with a dataset of stocks and relevant financial info and has tasked us with creating a analytical tool which will be used to help his parents invest wisely.

## Results
Although this tool has been configured to be flexible and take more annual datasets, below I will go over the results of the analysis for the datasets given by Steve (2017 and 2018).

### 2017
2017 was a strong year for green energy stocks all around with all but 1 of the 12 companies having a positive return at the end of the year; four of which saw a return of over 100%.

Below are images taken of the analysis runtimes for the both the initial and refactored code, respectively.

![2017 Runtime Refactored](https://github.com/tyler-sanzo/stock-analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)

From the images we can see the refactored code increased run efficiency by close to 80%.

### 2018
2018 was a major change from the previous year showing 10 of the 12 stocks having a negative return. The two stocks which experienced positive returns, ENPH and RUN, both showed strong returns of greater than 80%. One thing to note about these two is that while their 2018 returns were similar, ENPH's YOY return decreased from 130% while RUN saw a healthy increase compared to their prior year's 5.5% return.

![2018 Runtime Initial](https://github.com/tyler-sanzo/stock-analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Resources/initial_runtime_2018.PNG)

![2018 Runtime Refactored](https://github.com/tyler-sanzo/stock-analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

Again we see a similar runtime decrease using the refactored code.
