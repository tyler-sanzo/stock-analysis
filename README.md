# Annual Stock Analysis
Creating a tool using VBA scripting to analyze annual stock data.

## Project Overview
Steve, a friend who recently graduated with his finance degree, wants to help his parents make smart investment decisions within the green energy sector. Steve has provided us with a dataset of stocks and relevant financial info and has tasked us with creating a analytical tool which will be used to help his parents invest wisely.

## Results
Although this tool has been configured to be flexible and take more annual datasets, below I will go over the results of the analysis for the datasets given by Steve (2017 and 2018).
